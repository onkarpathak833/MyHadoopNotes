What is big data ?
what are structure, semi structure and unstructured data ?
3v's of big data -> volume, variety and velocity.
Batch data - older data, data that is already generated
 
, Near time Data-  less older data.. like data generated before few hrs
 , Real Time Data - data that is generated at runtime
 , Streaming Data - data generated by some other source and streamed into some system for analytics
 
why Hadoop ?
We need some system to handle huge data in parallel manner. Hadoop is distributed system.
Hadoop handles and operates on RAW data and not filtered data. (there are systems which converts raw i.e. unstructured data into some structured data like SAS). But Hadoop handles raw data.

Interactve SQL, Storm, Solr search engine
HBase and MongoDB are NoSQL Databases

Data Scale up :: increasing size/memory of machine. 
In Hadoop we can add nodes and process data in parallel and distributed manner. So scaling up (increasin resources of a node i.e. memory/CPU) is not an issue.
Data Scale out :: adding more resources to the existing resources.
Quantom of big data -> velocity of big data.
